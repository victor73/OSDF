OSDF Installation.

Requirements
=====================================================================
Node.js 0.6.x or more recent.
CouchDB 1.0.x or more recent.
ElasticSearch .18 or more recent.


1. Install the ElasticSearch river to feed off of changes from the CouchDB
server. If the both the ElasticSearch and CouchDB servers are installed on the
"localhost" with the default ports, and the CouchDB database that is used is
named "osdf", then the curl command to install the river would be: 

$ curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/osdf/_meta' -d '{ "type" : "couchdb", "couchdb" : { "user" : "elastic_idx", "password" : "XXXXXXXX", "host" : "localhost", "port" : 5984, "db" : "osdf", "filter" : null } }'

You will need to create the elatic_idx account and password in CouchDB for the
river to work properly.
