This is the Debian GNU prepackaged version of the OSDF RESTful HTTP servers.
This package provides the reference implementation source code, utilities, test
scripts, and documentation needed to run an instance of OSDF. OSDF was written
by developers at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of
Maryland, Baltimore. 

This package is authored and maintained by Victor Felix. The source for this
release was taken from:

http://ftp.sourceforge.net/projects/osdf/osdf-0.1.tar.gz

The changes were very minimal:

- Adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.
